## Introduction

System design is a critical skill for any software engineer working on real-world applications. It involves creating a blueprint for the architecture of a system that addresses scalability, reliability, performance, and maintainability. Whether you are designing a small web service or a large distributed system, system design principles help you understand how to approach complex requirements in a structured way.

## Why System Design?

Designing a scalable system is more than just writing code. It's about making strategic decisions that will impact the architecture, performance, and longevity of your system. This repository covers:

- **Scalability**: Ensuring your system can handle increased loads without compromising performance.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Building resilient systems that continue to function in the presence of failure.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing the system for speed, memory, and resource usage.
- **Security**: Protecting sensitive data and safeguarding the system from attacks.

## Core Concepts

### Load Balancing

Load balancing helps distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. There are various strategies, such as **round-robin** and **least connections**, that help achieve this.

### Caching

Caching is used to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on the database and speeding up response times. Techniques like **write-through** and **write-back** caching can be used depending on system requirements.

### Database Design

Choosing the right database is crucial for efficient storage and retrieval. We explore:
- **SQL vs NoSQL** databases
- **Normalization** and **denormalization**
- **Indexing** for fast lookups

### Sharding and Partitioning

To manage large datasets, **sharding** or **partitioning** splits data across multiple databases or tables. We discuss horizontal and vertical sharding, and how they help in scaling.

### Message Queues

Message queues like **Kafka** and **RabbitMQ** are essential in decoupling systems and enabling asynchronous communication between services.

### Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

A comparison of **microservices** (decentralized and scalable) and **monolithic** (centralized and simple) architectures, with their pros and cons.

### CAP Theorem

The **CAP Theorem** explains the trade-offs between **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance** in distributed systems. Learn when and how to make the right compromises based on your use case.

## Design Patterns

In this section, we cover commonly used design patterns in system architecture:
- **Load Balancer Pattern**
- **API Gateway Pattern**
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- **Event Sourcing**
- **Circuit Breaker**

## Case Studies

Dive into real-world case studies where system design principles were applied:
- Designing a URL Shortener like **Bit.ly**
- Building a scalable **Twitter** feed service
- Creating an **e-commerce** system like Amazon
- Implementing a video streaming service like **YouTube**

## Best Practices

Here are some key best practices to consider when designing systems:
- Always consider **failure points** and design for fault tolerance.
- **Horizontally scale** services where possible, rather than vertically.
- Make use of **caching layers** for high-read systems.
- Ensure **stateless services** for easier scaling.
- Regularly perform **load testing** to identify bottlenecks.
